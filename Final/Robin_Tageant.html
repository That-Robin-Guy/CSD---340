                        <h2>Robin's Biography:</h2>
                        <p>
                            I was born in a small town in southeastern Louisiana named Franklinton, only known locally for it's "Free" State fair it holds every fall.
                            I was born the cooler half of a set of twins.  At seven years old, my dad surrendered to the ministry and became a pastor. 
                            He whisked the family away to Mississippi.  Over the years until our colleges years we moved from church to church.  My brother and I stated college attending the University of Mobile.
                            I left college early to work full-time in retail, while he finished up his degree in Psychology.  
                            After he finished college, we moved in together.  We lived together until he passed from a car accident in 2018.  
                            His death, while extremely difficult even now, has sparked a fire in me to keep moving.  
                            Keep progressing in life.  This is part of the reason I have decided to go back to school to finish my bachelor's degree.
